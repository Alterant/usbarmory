Less automated or opaque than buildroot, this is a set of scripts and
configuration files to produce a small bootable filesystem image. The
components are fairly reusable; u-boot and linux could be used with a
filesystem based on a debian "debootstrap", for example.  Embedded in
the filesystem are the build configration files.

Scripts
=======
0_downloader.sh - download and extract the packages
1_linux.sh - build and stage linux
2_uboot.sh - build and stage u-boot
3_libc.sh - build and stage libc (using stage 1 kernel headers)
4_busybox.sh - build and stage busybox
5_dropbear.sh - build and stage dropbear
8_build_rootfs.sh - build various filesystem image formats

9_build_initrd.sh
